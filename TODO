Next step:

Modify (or rewrite) hello so that it can either work in MPI or non-MPI mode.
Make it similar to the implementation of OpenMP in NOMAD, i.e., the master
always does some work, and then if there are some workers available, they
work too. Make it easy to debug by using the non-MPI version.
Have the send and receive functions work in an "if MPI ... else" way.
The rest of the code must be equal for both MPI and non-MPI versions,
as much as possible.
